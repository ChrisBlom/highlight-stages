Highlight staged (quasi-quoted) expressions.

** Installation

Require this script

: (require 'highlight-stages)

and call function "highlight-stages-lisp-initialize"

: (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'highlight-stages-lisp-initialize)

** Supported Languages

Currently, Lisp only. But it's not very difficult to extend this
plug-in to other languages, like MetaOCaml or Template Haskell.

** Customizations

"highlight-stages-lighten-step" defines the strength of
highlight. Highlight gets brighter when set larger, and darker when
set smaller. It can also be a negative value.

When "highlight-stages-highlight-real-quote" is non-nil, not only
quasi-quotes(`) but also "real" quotes(') are highlighted.
