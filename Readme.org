We can easily recognize what are evaluated now and what are quoted for
later evaluation.

** NOTE: INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.3

highlight-stages now uses 5 fully customizable faces

- =highlight-stages-negative-level-face=
- =highlight-stages-level-1-face=
- =highlight-stages-level-2-face=
- =highlight-stages-level-3-face=
- =highlight-stages-higher-level-face=

to highlight stages, instead of generating temporary faces from
=highlight-stages-lighten-step= (fix issue #1).

Please configure these faces instead of setting
=highlight-stages-lighten-step=.

** Installation

Require this script

: (require 'highlight-stages)

and call function "highlight-stages-mode"

: (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'highlight-stages-mode)

If you want to enable "highlight-stages-mode" (almost) everywhere,
call "highlight-stages-global-mode" instead.

: (highlight-stages-global-mode 1)

** Supported Languages

Lisp-like languages and MetaOCaml

** Customizations

"highlight-stages-lighten-step" defines the strength of
highlight. Highlight gets brighter when set larger, and darker when
set smaller. It can also be a negative value.

When "highlight-stages-highlight-real-quote" is non-nil, not only
quasi-quotes(`) but also "real" quotes(') are highlighted.
