Highlight staged (quasi-quoted) expressions.

We can easily recognize what are evaluated now and what are quoted for
later evaluation.

** NOTE: IMCOMPATIBLE CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.1

highlight-stages is now a minor-mode.

please call =highlight-stages-mode= instead of
=highlight-stages-lisp-initialize= to enable highlight-stages.

** Installation

Require this script

: (require 'highlight-stages)

and call function "highlight-stages-mode"

: (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'highlight-stages-mode)

If you want to enable "highlight-stages-mode" (almost) everywhere,
call "highlight-stages-global-mode" instead.

: (highlight-stages-global-mode 1)

** Supported Languages

Lisp and MetaOCaml only. But it's not very difficult to extend this
plug-in to other languages, Template Haskell for example.

** Customizations

"highlight-stages-lighten-step" defines the strength of
highlight. Highlight gets brighter when set larger, and darker when
set smaller. It can also be a negative value.

When "highlight-stages-highlight-real-quote" is non-nil, not only
quasi-quotes(`) but also "real" quotes(') are highlighted.
